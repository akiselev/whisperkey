# Phase 1 Implementation Notes (Project Setup & Basic UI Shell)

## 1. Workspace Setup

- Updated `Cargo.toml` to include all required workspace members: `.`, `core`, and `transcriber`.
- Confirmed: `core` crate already existed. `transcriber` was missing and has been created.

## 2. Root Crate (`src/`) Setup

- `Cargo.toml` dependencies are present, but `relm4` and `gtk` are commented out. (Will need to enable/add these for actual GTK/Relm4 UI work.)
- `src/main.rs` exists; has substantial logic, but not a minimal Relm4/GTK app as described in the plan. (May need to refactor to match plan if strict adherence is required.)

## 3. Core Crate (`core/`) Setup

- `core/Cargo.toml` exists with dependencies. Confirmed as a library crate.
- Added a placeholder function `pub fn core_hello()` that logs a message using `tracing` per plan.md.

## 4. Transcriber Crate (`transcriber/`) Setup

- Created `transcriber/Cargo.toml` with dependencies: `tracing`, `tracing-subscriber`.
- Created `transcriber/src/main.rs` stub: initializes tracing, logs a startup message, and sleeps.

## 5. Basic System Tray Stub

- Created `src/tray.rs` as a stub with a placeholder `init_tray()` function.

# Phase 2 Implementation Notes (Stakker & Core Initialization)

## 1. Stakker Setup (`core/`)

- Added `stakker` and `tracing` as dependencies in `core/Cargo.toml`.
- Implemented `AppCoordinator` actor with a `CoordinatorMsg` enum and `handle` method for logging receipt of `HandleTest`.
- Added `CoreHandles` struct and `init_core_actors` function for spawning the coordinator actor.

## 2. Stakker Integration (`src/`)

- Uncommented/added `relm4` and `gtk4` dependencies in root `Cargo.toml`.
- Refactored `src/main.rs` to:
  - Initialize Stakker and core actors.
  - Store `CoreHandles` in the app model.
  - Launch a minimal Relm4 GTK window.

## 3. UIâ†’Core Communication

- Added a "Test Core" button to the GTK window.
- Defined `AppInput::TestCore` in the UI.
- On button click, `AppInput::TestCore` is sent to the app model, which calls `cast!` to send `CoordinatorMsg::HandleTest` to the coordinator.
- Coordinator logs receipt of the message via `tracing`.

## 4. Notes

- The previous audio/transcription logic in `main.rs` was replaced with the minimal Phase 2 UI/actor shell for strict plan compliance.
- The GTK/Relm4 shell is now functional and integrated with the actor system.
- Next: Implement audio capture and pipeline in Phase 3.

# Phase 3 Implementation Notes (Audio Capture)

## 1. Dependencies (`core/`)

- Added `cpal` crate for audio I/O (already in workspace dependencies).
- Using `std::sync::mpsc` for audio chunk communication between capture thread and coordinator.

## 2. Audio Types (`core/src/types.rs`)

- Created file.
- Defined `AudioChunk(Vec<f32>)`.
- Defined `AudioCaptureCmd { Start, Stop }`.
- Added placeholder `AppOutput { UpdateStatus(String) }` for UI communication back from core.

## 3. Audio Capture Actor (`core/src/audio_capture.rs`)

- Created file and implemented `AudioCaptureActor`.
- `init` takes `mpsc::Sender<AudioChunk>`.
- `handle` processes `AudioCaptureCmd::Start` and `AudioCaptureCmd::Stop`.
- `start_capture` uses `cpal` to get the default input device and stream.
- `cpal` stream callback converts data to `f32`, wraps in `AudioChunk`, and sends via `mpsc::Sender`.
- The `cpal::Stream` object is stored in the actor state to keep the stream alive.
- `stop_capture` drops the `Stream` object.
- Added basic error handling using `thiserror` and logging.

## 4. Coordinator Integration (`core/src/coordinator.rs`)

- Created file `core/src/coordinator.rs` (was missing).
- Added `Actor<AudioCaptureActor>` handle to `AppCoordinator`.
- Modified `CoordinatorMsg` to include `StartListening`, `StopListening`, `InternalAudioChunk(AudioChunk)`.
- Modified `AppCoordinator::init`:
  - Accepts a generic `ui_sender: Fn(AppOutput) + Send + Sync + 'static` (implemented via `Box<dyn Fn(...)>`).
  - Stores `ui_sender`.
  - Creates `mpsc::channel::<AudioChunk>()`.
  - Spawns `AudioCaptureActor`, passing the `mpsc::Sender`.
  - Spawns a dedicated thread to receive from `mpsc::Receiver<AudioChunk>`.
  - Receiver thread loop sends `CoordinatorMsg::InternalAudioChunk` to the coordinator using `self_ref.defer()`. Requires getting `actor_ref()` in `init`.
- Implemented `handle` for new messages:
  - `StartListening`/`StopListening`: Sends `AudioCaptureCmd::Start`/`Stop` to `audio_capture_actor` using `send()`.
  - `InternalAudioChunk`: Logs receipt (size).
- Implemented `send_status_to_ui` helper method using the stored `ui_sender` closure.
- Sends status updates to UI on start/stop and init.
- Modified `core/src/lib.rs`:
  - Added `pub mod audio_capture`.
  - Updated `init_core_actors` to be generic and accept `ui_sender`, passing it to `AppCoordinator::init`.

## 5. UI Integration (`src/main.rs`)

- Added `flume` dependency to root `Cargo.toml` (needed for `run_with_receive`).
- Defined `AppInput::{StartListening, StopListening}`.
- `AppModel::Output` is now `whisperkey_core::types::AppOutput`.
- Added `status_text: String` to `AppModel`.
- Updated `view!` macro:
  - Added `gtk::Label` bound to `model.status_text`.
  - Added "Start Listening" and "Stop Listening" `gtk::Button`s triggering corresponding `AppInput` messages.
- Updated `AppModel::init` to take `CoreHandles` as init parameter.
- Updated `AppModel::update`:
  - Handles `AppInput::StartListening`/`StopListening`: Sends `CoordinatorMsg::StartListening`/`StopListening` to coordinator using `core_handles.coordinator.defer()`.
- Implemented `AppModel::output` method:
  - Handles `AppOutput::UpdateStatus`: Updates `model.status_text`.
- Updated `main` function:
  - Creates a `flume` channel.
  - Creates a closure `ui_sender_closure` capturing the `flume` sender to pass to `init_core_actors`.
  - Calls `init_core_actors` _before_ running the app, passing the closure.
  - Uses `app.run_with_receive(core_handles, receiver)` to integrate the flume receiver with the Relm4 event loop.

## 6. Notes

- The audio capture pipeline (Capture Actor -> mpsc -> Receiver Thread -> Coordinator Actor) is established.
- UI can now trigger start/stop of audio capture.
- Core coordinator can send status updates back to the UI label.
- Next: Phase 4 - Stub Transcriber Process & IPC.
