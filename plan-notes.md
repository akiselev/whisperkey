# Phase 1 Implementation Notes (Project Setup & Basic UI Shell)

## 1. Workspace Setup
- Updated `Cargo.toml` to include all required workspace members: `.`, `core`, and `transcriber`.
- Confirmed: `core` crate already existed. `transcriber` was missing and has been created.

## 2. Root Crate (`src/`) Setup
- `Cargo.toml` dependencies are present, but `relm4` and `gtk` are commented out. (Will need to enable/add these for actual GTK/Relm4 UI work.)
- `src/main.rs` exists; has substantial logic, but not a minimal Relm4/GTK app as described in the plan. (May need to refactor to match plan if strict adherence is required.)

## 3. Core Crate (`core/`) Setup
- `core/Cargo.toml` exists with dependencies. Confirmed as a library crate.
- Added a placeholder function `pub fn core_hello()` that logs a message using `tracing` per plan.md.

## 4. Transcriber Crate (`transcriber/`) Setup
- Created `transcriber/Cargo.toml` with dependencies: `tracing`, `tracing-subscriber`.
- Created `transcriber/src/main.rs` stub: initializes tracing, logs a startup message, and sleeps.

## 5. Basic System Tray Stub
- Created `src/tray.rs` as a stub with a placeholder `init_tray()` function.

## Notes
- All steps from Phase 1 of plan.md have been implemented or stubbed.
- No actors, audio, or advanced UI logic introduced yet (per plan).
- Next: For full GTK/Relm4 shell, will need to uncomment/add those dependencies and refactor `main.rs` if strict plan adherence is required.
